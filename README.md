# Common Node Setup
A basic bash script containing commonly run node and npm commands when starting a new Node project.

As time goes by and I gain experience with developing REST APIs with Express.js and Node.js, I will build upon this script to automate mundane tasks.

## Running the script
After cloning the repository, you will want to grant execution authority to the script. Run the following in your terminal: `chmod +x common-node.sh`.

You can then run the script in your new project's directory using `./common-node.js`.
